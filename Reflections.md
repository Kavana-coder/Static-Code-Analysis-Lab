# 💡 Reflections on Inventory System Debugging and Improvement

## 🧾 Objective
The objective of this lab was to perform **static code analysis**, identify linting and security issues in `inventory_system.py`, and fix them to improve code quality, security, and maintainability.

## 🔍 Reflection on Issues & Learning

### 1. **Security Awareness**
- **Problem:** The original code used `eval()` and a bare `try–except–pass`, which are major security and debugging risks.
- **Learning:** I learned how `eval()` can execute arbitrary code and why specific exceptions like `except KeyError:` improve reliability.
- **Action:** Removed `eval()` and replaced it with safe alternatives. Used explicit exception handling.

### 2. **Code Maintainability**
- **Problem:** The code lacked docstrings, used inconsistent naming, and had unsafe default arguments.
- **Learning:** Following **PEP8 standards** improves readability and collaboration.
- **Action:** Added docstrings to all functions, renamed functions using snake_case, and handled default arguments safely.

### 3. **Resource & File Management**
- **Problem:** `open()` was used without `with` or encoding.
- **Learning:** The `with open()` context manager ensures files close automatically and prevents data corruption.
- **Action:** Replaced manual open/close with context managers and added UTF-8 encoding.

### 4. **Global Variables & Modularity**
- **Problem:** Use of `global` was flagged.
- **Learning:** Global variables reduce modularity but can be acceptable for shared state in small systems.
- **Action:** Retained `stock_data` globally with justification and documentation.

### 5. **Toolchain Experience**
- **Tools Used:**  
  - **pylint** – for style and coding standards  
  - **flake8** – for linting  
  - **bandit** – for security auditing  
- **Learning:** Understanding how different tools complement each other to identify unique issue categories.

## ⚙️ Prioritization of Fixes

| **Priority** | **Issue Type** | **Reason for Priority** | **Action Taken** |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| 🔴 High | Security (`eval()`, bare except) | Directly affects program safety | Removed / replaced |
| 🟠 Medium | File Handling & Encoding | Prevents resource leaks and data loss | Used `with open()` and added encoding |
| 🟢 Low | Style, Docstrings | Improves maintainability and readability | Added documentation and refactored naming |

## 🧩 Outcome & Reflection Summary

| **Aspect** | **Before** | **After** |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Code Security | Insecure due to `eval()` and bare excepts | Fully secured, compliant with Bandit |
| Code Readability | Inconsistent naming, no docstrings | PEP8-compliant, documented |
| Maintainability | Hard to debug and extend | Modular, readable, and safe |
| Pylint Score | 4.80 / 10 | 9.81 / 10 |
| Bandit Issues | 2 | 0 |
| Flake8 Issues | 2 | 0 |

## 🏁 Final Thoughts
This lab reinforced the importance of **static code analysis** in ensuring both **quality** and **security** of Python applications.  
It also highlighted that even simple programs can hide potential vulnerabilities and poor practices if not regularly analyzed with the right tools.

Through this process, I developed a stronger understanding of:
- Secure and Pythonic coding practices  
- Linting and compliance automation  
- Structured debugging workflows

**Final Result:**  
✅ All major issues fixed  
✅ Code verified secure  
✅ Clean reports with no remaining critical warnings  
✅ Ready for submission or GitHub publication
